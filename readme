Installation:
-------------

Compile using apxs. apxs may not be available by default on systems. You might have to install the required package containing apxs. Generally it comes with the apache devel package. For instance in ubuntu you could install apache2-prefork-dev. You will also need libapr and libapr-dev.

Something like the following command should work for the compilation.

sudo apxs2 -i -a -c <path to mod_dosblock_module.c>

You might have to reload/restart your apache after this

Configuration:
---------------
Currently we support the following directives DosBlockUrl, DosBlockHeader, DosBlockRule, DosBlockVerbose

You can define a url based subrule using the following syntax
 DosBlockUrl  <name of the  url subrule> < regexp pattern>
Example
 DosBlockUrl myurlrule /test
Header based subrule can be defined as follows
 DosBlockHeader <name of the header subrule> <header name>  <regexp pattern>
Example:
 DosBlockHeader myheaderrule User-Agent mozilla
Then you use the following syntax to do the real blocking
 DosBlockRule <dos rule name>:<name of the subrule> <threshold rate (hits per sec)> <time till blockage ( in secs)>

Example:
 DosBlockRule dosblock_header:myheaderrule 2 60

A complete example:
-------------------
 DosBlockUrl myurlrule /test
 DosBlockRule blocktest:myurlrule 50 120


In case you want to enable debugging you can set
 DosBlockVerbose On
Verbose logging is off by default
